<h3>What's not to love about CMSC 22? </h3>
<br>
<div>
<P>Aside from the very immersive and enjoyable topics discused in the </P>
<p>lab and lectures, the FICs from CMSC 22 were very delightful to have as instructors.</p>
<p>They explain challenging topics with such brevity and creativity to ensure that while we</p>
<p>students understand the topics in the simplest sense (without compromising the essence of the lessons)</p>
<p>also enjoyed and had the most out of our semester.Albeit taxing and challenging at times, </p>
<p>I really had the best time with the subject, and of course, Ma'am Miyah and Ma'am Kendall < /p>
<p>were very accomodating all throughout the sem, which made the load for us students even lighter</p>
<br>

<h3>Have you ever had a discussion that was more of a kwentuhan session than a class?</h3>
<br>
<div>
<p>Perhaps if I were to associate 1 word with my KAS 1 subject it would be "kwentuhan"</p>
<p>It was one of the GEs that I was able to have during the pre-pandemic and we had face-to-face sessions for this one.</p>
<p>It was like having coffee with your prof and he'd tell us stories not only about the past but some "teas" or some beefs between</p>
<p>one historian and the other. Before I took Computer Science as a course, I took BA History, and if there would be some fun takeaway</p>
<p>between people and history, is that historians have a lot of beef with each other and they feud in the classiest and academic way </p>
<p>I know, through writing papers and rebutting each other. Take Teodoro Agonicillo whose works we had to read and whose "heated arguments"</p>
<p>with some of the Filipino Historians were documented through their writings.</p>
<br><p>However, drama aside, through KAS 1 was I really able to appreciate our pre-colonial roots and gain better respect to our ancestors</p>
<p>Perhaps it was through KAS 1 that I was able to see how the Spaniards abused us and how they used Christianity as a means to oppress </p>
<p>us and deny us of our rights to our own land. I was also able to gain a better vantage of how women were placed in society during the</p>
<p>pre-colonial period and how we were set aside and placed in lower regard during the Spanish colonization. </p>
<p>To sum it all up, this course became the entry-point to my ongoing curiousity and awakening to our roots.</p>
<p>History provides a window for us to not only see, but also learn from our truths.</p>

<h3>Visual FoxPro is the best programming language I learned so far </h3>
<br>
<div>
<p>This is a programming language that I have learned outside of class, but so far I had the best experience with it.</p>
<p>It was very easy to learn, albeit having some learning curve along the way, it is beginner-friendly.</p>
<p>Although the language was very easy to learn, this does not hinder it from creating useful data-centric programs. </p>
<p>The forms and GUIs are a bit rudimentary as compared to some of its advanced successors like Visual Basic (also developed by Microsoft),</p>
<p>but it competes with VB in a sense that it is simpler to use and can generate advanced programs despite it being</p>
<p>"outdated". My experience with VB was rather challenging because of its complicated syntax and you have to link it to a third party</p>
<p>application like Microsoft Access to store data and generate Database Tables.</p>
<p>f I were to pick a language, however, that was taught in class to be my favourite, I'd say it is R.</p>
<p>I found R very useful in numerical computations and creating programs that would help solve complicated</p>
<p>Mathematical equations such as Matrix manipulation and Series computation. It can require a lot of analysis</p>
<p>and creativity along the way to think of a way to integrate and optimize the needed steps to solve equations in our</p>
<p>lab exercises, but once your program works, it is the kind of euphoria I wouldn't trade for anything else. </p>

<h3>All these talk about academics and programming is making me hungry</h3>
<br>
<div>
<p>I would die to have some steak right now! </p>
<p>What makes steak my favourite food is that it can be so expensive that you rarely get to eat it.</p>
<p>That's probably why it is sort of my "reward food" because when I eat it, I associate it with the feeling</p>
<p>of accomplishment, and of course, I only get that feeling occassionally, motivating me to work even harder</p>
<p>so I can gain that reward feeling :D </p>
