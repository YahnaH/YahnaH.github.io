<h3>What's not to love about CMSC 22? </h3>
<br>
<P>Aside from the very immersive and enjoyable topics discused in the </P>
<p>lab and lectures, the FICs from CMSC 22 were very delightful to have as instructors.</p>
<p>They explain challenging topics with such brevity and creativity to ensure that while we</p>
<p>students understand the topics in the simplest sense (without compromising the essence of the lessons)</p>
<p>also enjoyed and had the most out of our semester.</p>
<p>Albeit taxing and challenging at times, I really had the best time with the subject, and of course</p>
<p>Ma'am Miyah and Ma'am Kendall were very accomodating all throughout the sem. :))</p>
<br>
<h3>Have you ever had a discussion that was more of a kwentuhan session than a class?</h3>
<br>
<p>Perhaps if I were to associate 1 word with my KAS 1 subject it would be "kwentuhan"</p>
<p>It was one of the GEs that I was able to have during the pre-pandemic and we had face-to-face sessions for this one.</p>
<p>It was like having coffee with your prof and he'd tell us stories not only about the past but some "teas" or some beefs between</p>
<p>one historian and the other. Before I took Computer Science as a course, I took BA History, and if there would be some fun takeaway</p>
<p>between people and history, is that historians have a lot of beef with each other and they feud in the classiest and academic way </p>
<p>I know, through writing papers and rebutting each other. Take Teodoro Agonicillo whose works we had to read and whose "heated arguments"</p>
<p>with some of the Filipino Historians were documented through their writings.</p>
<br><p>However, drama aside, through KAS 1 was I really able to appreciate our pre-colonial roots and gain better respect to our ancestors</p>
<p>Perhaps it was through KAS 1 that I was able to see how the Spaniards abused us and how they used Christianity as a means to oppress </p>
<p>us and deny us of our rights to our own land. I was also able to gain a better vantage of how women were placed in society during the</p>
<p>pre-colonial period and how we were set aside and placed in lower regard during the Spanish colonization. </p>
<p>To sum it all up, this course became the entry-point to my ongoing curiousity and awakening to our roots.</p>
<p>History provides a window for us to not only see, but also learn from our truths.</p>
