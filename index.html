    <h3>&#127797 What's not to love about CMSC 22? &#127797</h3>
<div class = subj_sub>
    <P>Aside from the very immersive and enjoyable topics discussed in the lab and lectures, the FICs from CMSC 22 were very delightful to have as instructors.</p>
        <p>They explain challenging topics with such brevity and creativity to ensure that while we, students, understand the topics in the simplest sense (without compromising the essence of the lessons) also enjoyed and had the most out of our semester.</p>
        <p>Albeit taxing and challenging at times, I really had the best time with the subject, and of course, Ma'am Miyah and Ma'am Kendall were very accomodating all throughout the sem, which made the load for us students even lighter &#128516;</p>

    <h3>&#128173 Have you ever had a discussion that was more of a kwentuhan session than a class? &#128173</h3>
<div class = "subj_sub">
    <p>Perhaps if I were to associate 1 word with my KAS 1 subject it would be "kwentuhan".
        It was one of the GEs that I was able to have during the pre-pandemic and we had face-to-face sessions for this one.
        It was like having coffee with your prof and he'd tell us stories not only about the past but some "teas" or some beefs between one historian and the other.  </p>
    <p>Before I took Computer Science as a course, I took BA History, and if there would be some fun takeaway between people and history, is that historians have a lot of beef with each other and they feud in the classiest and academic way
        I know, through writing papers and rebutting each other. Take Teodoro Agoncillo  whose works we had to read and whose "heated arguments"
        with some of the Filipino Historians were documented through their writings.</p>
    
    <p>However, drama aside, through KAS 1 was I really able to appreciate our pre-colonial roots and gain better respect for our ancestors.
        Perhaps it was through KAS 1 that I was able to see how the Spaniards abused us and how they used Christianity as a means to oppress
        us and deny us of our rights to our own land. I was also able to gain a better vantage of how women were placed in society during the
        pre-colonial period and how we were set aside and placed in lower regard during the Spanish colonization. </p>
    <p>To sum it all up, this course became the entry point to my ongoing curiosity and awakening to our roots.
        History provides a window for us to not only see but also learn from our truths.</p>

    <h3> &#128175 Visual FoxPro is the best programming language I learned so far &#128175</h3>
<div class = "subj_sub">
    <p>This is a programming language that I have learned outside of class, but so far I had the best experience with it.
        It was very easy to learn, albeit having some learning curve along the way, it is beginner-friendly.
        Although the language was very easy to learn, this does not hinder it from creating useful data-centric programs.
        The forms and GUIs are a bit rudimentary as compared to some of its advanced successors like Visual Basic (also developed by Microsoft),
        but it competes with VB in a sense that it is simpler to use and can generate advanced programs despite it being
        "outdated". My experience with VB was rather challenging because of its complicated syntax and you have to link it to a third-party
        applications like Microsoft Access to store data and generate Database Tables.</p>

    <p>If I were to pick a language, however, that was taught in class to be my favourite, I'd say it's R.
        I found R very useful in numerical computations and creating programs that would help solve complicated
        Mathematical equations such as Matrix manipulation and Series computation. It can require a lot of analysis
        and creativity along the way to think of a way to integrate and optimize the needed steps to solve equations in our
        lab exercises, but once your program works, it is the kind of euphoria I wouldn't trade for anything else. </p>

    <h3>&#127860 All these talk about academics and programming is making me hungry &#127860</h3>
<div class = "subj_sub">
<p style="text-align: center;">I would die to have some steak right now! &#128523 </p>
<p>What makes steak my favorite food is that it can be so expensive that you rarely get to eat it.
    That's probably why it is sort of my "reward food" because when I eat it, I associate it with the feeling
    of accomplishment, and of course, I only get that feeling occasionally, motivating me to work even harder
    so I can gain that rewarding feeling &#128151 </p>
